# Micro-Frontends

This repo is an example implementation of an application implemented using micro-frontends.
The project is meant to serve as a basis to explore and build a micro-frontends architecture using Module Federation for enterprise applications.

The following articles cover the implementation of this repository:

> [First Article](https://medium.com/xgeeks/micro-frontends-at-scale-part-1-a8ab67bfb773) - Tackling the architecture

> [Second Article](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/micro-frontends-at-scale-part-2-d10994f09f18) - Tackling the implementation

They explain why to follow this approach, some pros and cons and also the choices done until achieving this architecture and solution.
Some of the common problems that happen when using Module Federation are also covered.

# Commands

> yarn start // starts the dev servers
> 
> yarn start:live // starts the dev servers with hot reloading on
> 
> yarn build:serve:all // buils all MFEs for production and serves them all with serve
